# TurtleSketchArt
Simple Drawing app using the turtle module using python

# HOW IT WORKS
- You use the w,s,a,d keys to move the turtle in the up,down,left,right directions.
- q,e,c,z to move it in the diagonal directions
- o to turn off the brush and move it
- i to turn on the brush and pain with it

# FEATURES TO BE ADDED
- Code to enable user to colour inside of the strokes
- Code to allow user to change the colour of the turtle in between brush strokes
- Code to set a separate .gif file as the background picture ( this one's gonna be pretty short) 
- Recheck function closeapp @ line 100
- Any method to make to whole system of writing the commands to the file viable ( such as bringing in loops to iterate over
  repeated pieces of code)



# WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES
- Let's you sketch using the turtle module in python
- saves your sketch in the form of turtle commands to a .txt file 
  which you can later rename to a .py file.
